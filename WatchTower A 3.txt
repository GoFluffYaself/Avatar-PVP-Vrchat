PC; we are an Avatar PVP group representing the Hive from Destiny.
We commit violence. Sometimes with other groups that also use Fluff's PVP setup. Sometimes we may call on you to aid in bolstering our numbers for larger-scale battles.

We have 'Rave Nights' every Sunday, which are essentially Chaotic PVP events - you're welcome to join them if you have time; they span from 11pm to midnight*.
We also partake in a joint Games Night with the House of Resurrection every Friday at 11pm.
Like most Avatar PVP groups, event attendance will provide progress to ranking up and earning access to stronger units; our events last up to an hour unless people want more carnage.
What's unique to us is our 'Operations' - special events which have elements of story that may take place on purpose-built maps, often involving a series of events, 
over which the story is told either via announcements or light-RP moments in said event(s).

As ever, though; the more the merrier.
*Kol here informing you that these are in the UK timezone (GMT), these usually equate to ~5:30pm EST with some variance depending on Daylight Savings.
