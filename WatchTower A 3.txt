The Ashen empire is a Star wars inspired avatar PvP PC and Quest community. 
We engage in several different forms of combat such as TDM, FFA, hostage rescue, boss battles and many more. We also play games outside of PvP events in both vrchat and other games. We host events most days between 4pm EST and 8pm EST.

What to expect from our events:
>Custom class board made and balanced for different avatars
>An ever expanding list of worlds and avatars
>Tournaments between battalions
>Galactic war story events starting May 4th
