P.S: We have a poll-controlled Sunday PVP event we call the 'Rave Night'.
By reading this, you are invited.
*Legal age of 18 or equivalent in your species' years is recommended.
Waking up as a Hive is not for everyone. You will experience a ravenous hunger for violence and dismantling of illogical constructs such as 'civilization' and 'false shapes'. 
Failure to feed/appease the Worm your God may result in intensified experiences and/or death.
