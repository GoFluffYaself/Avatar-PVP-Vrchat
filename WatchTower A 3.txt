The Synthenoid Unity, a species of mechanical beings using crystals as a power source.

As we are just starting up, we intend to be PVP focused as well as have regular hangouts. [We do not run or support drinking nights]

The server and community was created by Shio Sagamoto and is ran by him and myself.

Start as a seedling, equipped with deadly, rotating blades, or a drone with a claw and laser gun, and work your way up to higher, deadlier ranks. Blow your enemies away with a laser cannon, or utilise a sharp, dexterous sword. Strut your stuff with custom colours!

We strive to create a warm and welcoming environment, that makes things simple and fun.
