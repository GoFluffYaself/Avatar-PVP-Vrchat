The Iron Hands is a dedicated player community that specializes in both roleplay (RP) and Avatar PvP within the Warhammer 40k universe. 
We are a growing group of individuals who have a particular interest in exploring the lesser-explored lore surrounding the Iron Hands Chapter. 
While we place a strong emphasis on the fun and competitive aspects of Avatar PvP, we also host RP events for those who prefer that style of engagement. 
Our community strives to maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment for all players, fostering camaraderie as we unite in the defense of the Imperium of Man.
